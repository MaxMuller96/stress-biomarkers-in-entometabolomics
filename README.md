# stress-biomarkers-in-entometabolomics
An algorithm that uses natural language processing for listing of stress biomarkers in insects in metabolomics derived from published papers.
The algorithm is written in Python in file stressbiomarkers_insects.py.
The referenced papers need to be downloaded manually.
Databases need to be downloaded locally from GBIF.org for the taxa and HMDB.ca for the metabolites.
