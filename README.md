# stress-biomarkers-in-entometabolomics
An algorithm that uses natural language processing for listing of stress biomarkers in insects in metabolomics derived from published papers.
The algorithm is written in Python in file stressbiomarkers_insects.py.

The referenced papers need to be downloaded manually.
Databases need to be downloaded locally from GBIF.org for the taxa and HMDB.ca for the metabolites.

**Startup**
Install python 3.14 or lower and an IDE like Spyder or Jupyter.
Download requirements.txt and place it in the project directory.
In the terminal execute: cd "directory" and py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
If the packages are installed, open the code in Spyder or Jupyter.
Run the code.
