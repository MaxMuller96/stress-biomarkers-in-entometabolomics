# stress-biomarkers-in-entometabolomics
An algorithm that uses natural language processing for listing of stress biomarkers in insects in metabolomics derived from published papers.
The algorithm is written in Python in file stressbiomarkers_insects.py. 
Databases used for this algorithm can be found in the map 'databases'. 'Taxon.txt' contains all the taxa of the biosphere derived from GBIF.org and 'metabolites-2025-06-20.txt' contains all metabolites and is derived from the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB).
